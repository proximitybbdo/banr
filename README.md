Banr
====

Small Air app to generate flash banner gif/jpg alternatives automagically

So you make Flash banners, and then you have to create the alternative gif/jpg. Always a hassle when you have to do 20+ of them, right? Wrong! Use Banr to do it for you. Just drag in your swf files, hit "Go", and wait for the jpg's to be spit out. You can tweak the quality a little too!

Installation
------------
You need the Adobe Air runtime to run the app (since it's an Air app, du-uh), which you can grab from Adobe for free. Then just download the latest version at the top here.

I want more
-----------
If you want more or different features, you can make a fork request to help make Banr better, or just make your own. All is on github.
