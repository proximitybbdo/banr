    <h1>Banr</h1>

    <p>So you make Flash banners, and then you have to create the <em>alternative gif/jpg</em>. Always a hassle when you have to do 20+ of them, right? Wrong! Use Banr to do it for you. Just drag in your swf files, hit "Go", and wait for the jpg's to be spit out. You can tweak the quality a little too!</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>You <em>need</em> the Adobe Air runtime to run the app (since it's an Air app, du-uh), which you can grab from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe</a> for free. Then just download the latest version at the top here.</p>

    <h2>I want more</h2>
    <p>If you want more or different features, you can make a fork request to help make Banr better, or just make your own. All is on <a href="https://github.com/proximitybbdo/banr">github</a>.</p>
